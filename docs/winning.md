## üß† ADVANCED CHAT STRATEGIES

### **Agent Mode - For Complex Changes**
Perfect for:
- Multi-file refactoring
- Feature implementation
- Architecture changes
- Bug fixes across codebase

**Example prompts:**
```
"Implement user authentication across the entire app with JWT"
"Refactor the monolith into microservices architecture"
"Add TypeScript support to the entire React project"
"Convert this REST API to GraphQL"
```

### **Ask Mode - For Understanding**
Perfect for:
- Code explanations
- Learning new concepts
- Debugging assistance
- Best practices

### **Power Prompting Techniques**

#### **1. Context-Rich Prompts**
```
# Instead of: "Fix this function"
# Use: "Fix this authentication function to handle edge cases like expired tokens, invalid users, and rate limiting"
```

#### **2. Specification-Driven Development**
```
"Create a complete e-commerce API with the following specs:
- User authentication (JWT)
- Product catalog with search/filter

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING & PERFORMANCE

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Cursor Performance**
```
# If Cursor is slow:
1. Clear cache: Ctrl + Shift + P ‚Üí "Cursor: Clear Cache"
2. Restart language servers: Ctrl + Shift + P ‚Üí "Restart Language Servers"
3. Reduce context size: Limit @folder usage
4. Disable unused extensions
5. Increase memory allocation in settings
```

#### **Performance Optimization**
```
# Optimize for large projects:
1. Use specific @file instead of @folder
2. Limit context to relevant files only
