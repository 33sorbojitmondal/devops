# Contributing to DevOps Todo App

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this DevOps learning project! This guide will help you get started with contributing code, documentation, and improvements.

## üéØ Project Goals

This project is designed to teach DevOps fundamentals through hands-on experience. Our goals are:

- **Educational**: Provide clear examples of DevOps practices
- **Practical**: Use real-world tools and workflows
- **Accessible**: Welcome contributors of all skill levels
- **Comprehensive**: Cover the full DevOps lifecycle

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16 or higher
- Git
- GitHub account
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and React

### Setup Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/devops-todo-app.git
   cd devops-todo-app
   ```
3. **Verify your setup**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/verify-setup.js
   ```
4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Frontend
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```
5. **Start the development servers**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd backend && npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

We follow the **Feature Branch Workflow** with these conventions:

### Branch Naming
- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `test/description` - Test improvements
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring

### Commit Messages
We use [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/):

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation
- `test:` Tests
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `ci:` CI/CD changes
- `style:` Code style changes

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(frontend): add todo priority levels
fix(backend): resolve database connection issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(api): add integration tests for todo endpoints
```

### Step-by-Step Contribution Process

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Write code following our style guides
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   cd backend && npm test
   cd frontend && npm test
   
   # Run linting
   npm run lint
   
   # Verify setup still works
   node scripts/verify-setup.js
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

5. **Push and create PR**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

## üìù Code Style and Quality

### JavaScript/React Guidelines
- Use ES6+ features
- Follow React functional component patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`

### Testing Guidelines
- Write unit tests for new functions
- Add integration tests for API endpoints
- Test React components with React Testing Library
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use descriptive test names

### Documentation Guidelines
- Update README.md for major changes
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Update API documentation for new endpoints
- Include examples in documentation

## üß™ Testing Standards

### Backend Testing
```bash
cd backend
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:watch         # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage      # Coverage report
```

**Required:**
- Unit tests for all new functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Minimum 80% code coverage

### Frontend Testing
```bash
cd frontend
npm test                   # Run all tests
npm run test:ui           # Interactive testing
```

**Required:**
- Component tests for new UI components
- Integration tests for user workflows
- Accessibility tests

## üöÄ CI/CD Guidelines

### GitHub Actions
Our CI pipeline automatically:
- Runs all tests
- Checks code style
- Builds the application
- Runs security scans

**Before submitting a PR:**
- Ensure all CI checks pass
- Review the CI output for any warnings
- Fix any linting or test failures

### Pull Request Checklist
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Commit messages follow convention
- [ ] PR description explains the change
- [ ] No merge conflicts
